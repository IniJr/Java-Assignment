# Algorithm Analysis

## Compare with other sorts we have learned, and give a conclusion

## Can you create a new method and can do merge without initiating a new list?
Yes, this variant of merge implementation is popularly known as inplace merge sort

## Compare the runtime performance between the new merge implementation and the original one, which is more efficient?
The original one

## Give a conclusion about what kinds of operations has the most significant impact on runtime performance.
Iteration

## What kind of Operations in merge sort take the largest amount of time?
