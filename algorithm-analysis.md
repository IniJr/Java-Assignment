#Algorithm Analysis

##Compare with other sorts we have learned, and give a conclusion

##Can you create a new method and can do merge without initiating a new list?
Yes, this variant of merge implementation is popularly known as inplace merge sort

##Compare the runtime performance between the new merge implementation and the original one, which is more efficient?
The original one

##Give a conclusion about what kinds of operations has the most significant impact on runtime performance.
Iteration

##What kind of Operations in merge sort take the largest amount of time?

##Using times of swap to estimate runtime performance of sorting algorithms
